# The Garden Guidebook
 A collaborative guidebook for the Garden bouldering area generated using the [LocalBoulders framework](https://github.com/AndrewChild/LocalBoulders). The book is currently unfinished but a work in progress PDF can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/AndrewChild/The-Garden-Guidebook/raw/main/guideBook.pdf).

# ToDo:
## Things that can be done at home
- Draw topo for cabbage patch
- write descriptions for placeholder routes

## Things that I'm not sure if I should add
- Consider rearranging all routes to read left to right (right now cliff reads right to left)
- Essay/Flavor text inserts
  - Ethics of developing the Meth Lab prow
  - Who is E?
  - Other berned
  - KISS
  - Whats under the moss/New FAs
  - Tombstone pillar
  - Lowest viable start vs LRS
  - Route name explanations:
    - Burning Bus
	- Harbor Freight
	- Worf
	- Dab Rig Boulder
	- Francois
- possible lists to include in index
  - good routes for total beginners
  - routes that dry quickly
  - routes that dry un-quickly
  - Top Rope-able routes
  - old school circuits
  - safe-ish with one pad
  - The best of not the best (2 star lines)
- should the upper garden be split into upper and middle?
- Should variations be indexed? maybe there should be a tier below variation that doesn't get indexed?
- Should all routes be included in the subarea layout maps (right now if there are two badges that would overlap I just include one)
- Should areas be reordered? Right now they are listed main first then in order of how close they are to the main. Might make more sense to list them in terms of distance from Sweethome
