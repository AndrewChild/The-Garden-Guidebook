# The Garden Guidebook
 A collaborative guidebook for the Garden bouldering area generated using the LocalBoulders framework. The book is currently unfinished but a work in progress PDF can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/AndrewChild/The-Garden-Guidebook/raw/main/guideBook.pdf).

# ToDo:
- Routes to add:
	- Spray skirt
	- All Berned down
	- crazy cool arete
	- Other lines on Es dirty B
	- highball right of Daryl Philbin
	- Enchilada variations
	- hanging prow project
	- cargo net project (The good project in EBs book?) on the "big" boulder
	- E's V7 low
	- everything in pink tag
	- everything in middle garden
	- Pumpkin spice low
	- Arboretum sit
- Add routes for areas outside garden main
- fill in route info
- add compass to maps
- Add something to intro about definition and naming of routes
- add something about information sourcing
- reorganize image files
- Tracy Brandlt has cleaned and re-established a lot of lines that I haven't documented. Would be best to just talk through them with him since many don't have names and he desrves first dibs on what they are called

# specific issues
- Where should topo lines start, at the hand holds or from the base (from the base looks better but hand holds is sometimes informative)
