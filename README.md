# The Garden Guidebook
 A collaborative guidebook for the Garden bouldering area generated using the [LocalBoulders framework](https://github.com/AndrewChild/LocalBoulders). The book is currently unfinished but a work in progress PDF can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/AndrewChild/The-Garden-Guidebook/raw/main/guideBook.pdf).

# ToDo:
## Things that can be done at home
- Draw topo for cabbage patch
- write descriptions for placeholder routes

## Things that I'm not sure if I should add
- Essay/Flavor text inserts
  - Ethics of developing the Meth Lab prow
  - Who is E?
  - Other berned
  - KISS
  - Whats under the moss/New FAs
  - Tombstone pillar
  - Lowest viable start vs LRS
  - Route name explanations:
    - Burning Bus
	- Harbor Freight
	- Worf
	- Dab Rig Boulder
	- Francois
- possible lists to include in index
  - good routes for total beginners
  - routes that dry quickly
  - routes that dry un-quickly
  - Top Rope-able routes
  - old school circuits
  - safe-ish with one pad
  - The best of not the best (2 star lines)
- should the upper garden be split into upper and middle?
- Should variations be indexed? maybe there should be a tier below variation that doesn't get indexed?
- Should all routes be included in the subarea layout maps (right now if there are two badges that would overlap I just include one)
