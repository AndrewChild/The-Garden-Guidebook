# The Garden Guidebook
 A collaborative guidebook for the Garden bouldering area generated using the LocalBoulders framework. The book is currently unfinished but a work in progress PDF can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/AndrewChild/The-Garden-Guidebook/raw/main/guideBook.pdf).

# ToDo:
- Add routes for areas outside garden main
- fill in route info
- Area Map
- sub area maps
- topos
- intro
- add icon for unconfirmed grades

# specific issues
- should pink tag just be a subarea of the garden proper. Since the parking is the same the only difference between pink tag and another side area is that its across the road. seems a little arbitrary.
- route names/IDs on undertow boulder (which line is "undertow" what is it called when you start as for undertow stand then traverse right (I called it riptide, but thats made up). Should spray skirt and spray against the undertow be added?
- should other routes next to Dr. Evil be added at all (i.e. number 2, and mole)
- should the siren be two routes? Like left arete imediately, right arete are pretty different and feel maybe 1 V grade appart. I think its pretty neat that its one route that you can do a few ways, but IDK its an interesting thought.
- Where should topo lines start, at the hand holds or from the base (from the base looks better but hand holds is sometimes informative)
- numbering based on sub areas or area?
- In general what to do with unknown routes. Make up a name or asign generic name (Problem A, etc).
- Reorganize subareas and boulders into a logical order.
