# The Garden Guidebook
 A collaborative guidebook for the Garden bouldering area generated using the [LocalBoulders framework](https://github.com/AndrewChild/LocalBoulders). The book is currently unfinished but a work in progress PDF can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/AndrewChild/The-Garden-Guidebook/raw/main/guideBook.pdf).
