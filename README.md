# The Garden Guidebook
 A collaborative guidebook for the Garden bouldering area generated using the LocalBoulders framework. The book is currently unfinished but a work in progress PDF can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/AndrewChild/The-Garden-Guidebook/raw/main/guideBook.pdf).

# ToDo:
- Add routes for areas outside garden main
- fill in route info
- add compass to maps
- create release and inDev branches

# specific issues
- Where should topo lines start, at the hand holds or from the base (from the base looks better but hand holds is sometimes informative)
- numbering based on sub areas or area?
