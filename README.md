# The Garden Guidebook
 A collaborative guidebook for the Garden bouldering area generated using the LocalBoulders framework. The book is currently unfinished but a work in progress PDF can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/AndrewChild/The-Garden-Guidebook/raw/main/guideBook.pdf).

# ToDo:
- Routes to add:
	- crazy cool arete
	- everything in pink tag
	- everything in middle garden
	- Pumpkin spice low
- add compass to maps
- Add something to intro about definition and naming of routes
- add something about information sourcing
- reorganize image files
- Tracy Brandlt has cleaned and re-established a lot of lines that I haven't documented. Would be best to just talk through them with him since many don't have names and he desrves first dibs on what they are called
- A lot of topos are very dark should go back on a cloudy day and shoot in HDR
- Consider adding a master codex of routes and their aliases
- Consider adding a section for eliminates (KISS, enchilad original, and spraycation probably others too)
