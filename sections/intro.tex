\section{Authors Note}
This is an early draft of what I hope will some day be a more comprehenisve guidebook to the greater Sweethome area, many details have been substituted for placeholder values or omitted entierly. Moreover everything contained within is a work in progress. If you would like to contribute your knowledge to this project please get in touch with me (I can be contacted via git hub or my personal email: an.child@gmail.com).
\subsection*{Future Plans}
The following items haven't been implemented in this guidebook yet, but I hope to include them at some point in the future.
\begin{itemize}
\item Cover pages\\
\item Action/scenery Photos. I intend to fill empty space (and occasionally add pages) with action photos throughout this guide in order to inspire readers towards aesthetic lines and highlight the natural beauty of the area. An additional goal is to feature a diverse group of subjects (i.e. not just me and my mostly white mostly male friends) in these photos. If you have any good photos that you would like to share please get in touch.\\
\item More information on history of climbing at the garden and first ascents.\\
\item GPS idexes of boulders and cliffs.\\'
\item More areas. The final section of this book lists several other areas that are nearby the Garden. Some of these areas will be added as full sections to this book as more information on them is collected.
\item Print version. When this book is sufficiently complete I would like to do an indie print run. The print run would be just for fun, I have no intention of making a profit from this project so print copies would be sold at cost (hopefuly at a very reasonable price).
\end{itemize}
\section{Ameneties}
\subsection*{Toilets}
Barring emergencies, digging catholes should be avoided when climbing at the Garden Main area. As an alternative consider driving 1.9 miles back towards sweethome to use the pit toilets outside of sunnyside park. The three minute drive will take roughly the same amount of time as fiding a seculded spot and digging a hole and you won't have to worry about squatting on a patch of poison oak. Likewise most of the areas in this book exist within a 5 minutes drive of a toilet or pit toilet, think about it. 
\subsection*{Camping}
Paid campsites can be reserved at Sunny Side Park 1.9 miles away from the Garden Main area. Dispersed camping is allowed on any of the pullouts on Quartzville Creek road East of Green Peter Resivour. Camping is not allowed at the Garden Main or Upper Garden areas.
\section{Local Ethics}
The Garden Main and Upper Garden areas are located on private land owned by the Cascade Timber Company. The company allows walk in access to their land, but there is no official relationship between the landowners and climbers. The established ethic for climbing on timber land in Oregon is that the owners prefer not to get involved, consequently climbers should do their best to keep a low-ish profile and ensure the land owners don't need to get involved. There are a few specific activies which could threaten access for everyone:\\
\begin{itemize}
\item Building fires or causing fire hazards.\\
\item Parking on or blocking gated forest roads.\\
\item Overnight camping at the climbing areas.\\
\item Failing to obay posted fire closures.\\
\end{itemize}
\subsection*{Open and Closed Projects}
The book notes several lines that have yet to see a first ascent. Generally boulder projects are understood to be "Open" which is to say that no one has dibs on them and they may be climbed by anyone. These projects are infact included as a way to encourage and inspire climbers to check out and establish new lines.\\
\\
Rope climbs on the other hand may be either "Open" (anyone can get on it) or "Closed" (the developer has requested others to wait until they are finished establishing the route). Closed projects are custimarily marked with a piece of red string or webbing on the first bolt.\\
\\
There are many reasons why a route developer may choose to "Close" a project. It may be as simple as the developer hasn't finished cleaning and bolting the route. however more commonly the developer is just requesting the privialge of the first ascent of the route and the naming rights that come along with it. Route development takes a good deal of time and money (each bolt on a sport climb costs upwards of \$6) thus its consiered reasonable for a route developer ask for a period of first dibs on the fruit of their labors. Failure to obay this request is considered route theivery and its not a good way to make friends.\\
\subsection*{We like the moss}
The lush moss coverings that adorn the boulders are an essential part of the area's charm. When cleaning boulders and routes try to take a conservative approach and avoid demossing uneccissary parts of the boulder.
\section{Poison Oak}
The Upper Garden area is plagued by poison oak and it has been seen in patches in other areas as well. Tread carefully and watch out for low growing shubs with waxy leaves in clusters of three. The leaves turn red durring the fall and fall off in the winter. Exposure to any part of the plant can cause irritation.\\

\section{How to use this book}
\subsection*{Route names}
It isn't uncommon for a section of stone at the Garden to go by multiple different names. In such cases this guidebook seeks call a route what ever name is currently most commonly used (usually the name a route is given on Mountain Project). Other names are often noted in the routes discription. In cases where a route has no known name a name has been made up for this guidebook (these route names are marked with an asterisk).

\subsection*{Grades and Descriptions}
As much as posible the grades and descriptions of routes in this book have been based on the collective first hand experience of the collaborators of this book. Instances where first hand experience is limited or unavailable are graded with an asterisk.\\
\\
Boulder problems in this book are graded on the Hueco V scale and roped climbs are graded using the Yosemite decimal system. Although these grades are inherently subjective, care has been taken in considering the grading of each route. A color coding system is applied for ease of use as described below.\\
\newline
\colorbox{green!20}{\textbf{Boulder problems V0-V3}}\\
\colorbox{RoyalBlue!20}{\textbf{Boulder problems V4-V6}}\\
\colorbox{Goldenrod!50}{\textbf{Boulder problems V7-V9}}\\
\colorbox{red!20}{\textbf{Boulder problems V10+}}\\
\colorbox{green!20}{\textbf{Roped climbs 5.0-5.9}}\\
\colorbox{RoyalBlue!20}{\textbf{Roped climbs 5.10a-5.11d}}\\
\colorbox{Goldenrod!50}{\textbf{Roped climbs 5.12a-5.13d}}\\
\colorbox{red!20}{\textbf{Roped climbs 5.14a+}}\\

\subsection*{Ratings for Quality and Seriousness}
In additon to a difficulty rating, route quality and seriousness ratings are provided on an out of three system as defined below.
\subsubsection{Quality}
\begin{tabular}{rcp{0.75\linewidth}}
\ding{72} \ding{72} \ding{72}&-&This route is an area classic, if you are unfamiliar with the area this is one you should check out on your first visit.\\
\ding{72} \ding{72}&-&This route is charming, but may be lacking one or more qualities of a true classic.\\
\ding{72}&-&This route may leave something to be desired but isn't objectively terrible.\\
\ding{73}&-&Zero stars, this route is bad.\\
&-&No quality rating given, this designation is typically only included for Projects and routes that the collaborators of this guide do not have first hand knowledge of.\\
\end{tabular}\\
\subsubsection{Seriousness}
\begin{tabular}{rcp{0.75\linewidth}}
&-&No seriousness rating given, this is gerneally a safe climb with appropriate padding/protection. There are no extraordinary hazards that you should be aware of.\\
\warn&-&A boulder with this rating may have insecure moves which are high off the ground or over a bad landing or both. A roped climb with this rating may have sections were falling presents risk of injury. A competent climber who is aware of these hazards will still be able to climb this at a minimaly increased risk.\\
\warn \warn&-&There are sections of this climb where the risks are hard to minimize. Falls in certain areas may be unlikely for a climber of appropriate skill level but the consequences of such a fall could be real.\\
\warn \warn \warn&-&This route could cause searious injury or worse even when attempted by a person competent at climbing the assigned grade. This climb should be approached with caution.\\
\end{tabular}
\subsection*{A Reminder}
The rocks do not know what they are called or how they are supposed to be climbed, likewise your experience does not need to depend on this information. Do not let the descriptions, grades, and ratings assigned in this book prevent you from experienceing the rocks as they are.
