\section{Ameneties}
\subsection*{Toilets}
Barring emergencies digging catholes should be avoided when climbing at the Garden Main area. As a alternative consider driving 1.9 miles back towards sweethome to use the pit toilets outside of sunnyside park. The three minute drive will take roughly the same amount of time as fiding a seculded spot and digging a hole and you won't have to worry about squatting on a patch of poison oak. Likewise all of the areas in this book exist within a 5 minutes drive of a toilet or pit toilet. 
\subsection*{Camping}
Paid campsites can be reserved at Sunny Side Park 1.9 miles away from the Garden Main area. Dispersed camping is allowed on any of the pullouts on Quartzville Creek road East of Green Peter Resivour. Camping is not allowed at the Garden Main or Upper Garden areas.
