\section{A - The Upper Garden Cliffs}\phantomsection\label{sa:The Upper Garden Cliffs}
The Upper Garden is borderd by an extensive cliff line which is both longer and (in some places) taller than the Garden Cliffs. Unfortunatly the area around the cliff and the cliff itself are both covered in poison oak. A free rope adorns the cliff above the Dr. Strangelove boulder for anyone who wants it. Said rope exists as the only remenats of a would be delveloper who found himself sorounded by poison oak and gave up, never to return.

Sparse deposits solid rock dots the landscape high above the Santiam along Gordon Ridge. This region was developed in the early 2010s but it never caught on in the same way that the Garden did and today very little evidence of climbing remains. The center of this previous wave of development was an area called "The Vines". Being a tallus feild located at high elevation (4000') this area probably has a slightly different season than the Garden.

The Needles is a large formation of basalt pillars located high in the hills south of detroit lake. The walls are arount 100' tall in some sections.
Andrew Child and Alex Funk went on an expedition to this crag in the Summer of 2018. They climbed a few routes and found no evidence of other climbing, nor any fixed gear that would indicate prior descents. The rock isn't as soild as the garden cliffs but it is of good enough quality for climbing, there is substantial potential for adventure trad climbing here. It is possible that this crag was adversely effected by the 2020 wildfires. If you would like to explore this area feel free to reach out to the author of this guide for more information.\\

Squat start with hands matched on a double pinch feature at the center of of the lichen covered scoop. Trending right out of the scoop is a little easier than staying left. Giving this route two stars may be generous.

The Needles is a large formation of basalt pillars located high in the hills south of detroit lake. The walls are arount 100' tall in some sections.
Andrew Child and Alex Funk went on an expedition to this crag in the Summer of 2018. They climbed a few routes and found no evidence of other climbing, nor any fixed gear that would indicate prior descents. The rock isn't as soild as the garden cliffs but it is of good enough quality for climbing, there is substantial potential for adventure trad climbing here. It is possible that this crag was adversely effected by the 2020 wildfires. If you would like to explore this area feel free to reach out to the author of this guide for more information.\\
