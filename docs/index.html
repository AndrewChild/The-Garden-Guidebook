        <h1>About the Project</h1>  
		<h2>Scope</h2>  
		<p>The Garden Guidebook is intended to be a comprehensive guide to the climbing at the Garden climbing area outside of Sweet Home, Oregon. Additional sections are included to document other nearby areas, but these areas are not covered in as great of detail. The guidebook is a living document that has been continuously developed since July of 2022. A PDF version is available for free <a href="https://github.com/AndrewChild/The-Garden-Guidebook/raw/main/guideBook.pdf">online</a> and a print version is in development.</p>
		<h2>Information Sources</h2>  
		<p>Much of the information in this book has been sourced from my own first hand knowledge of the area. I have been climbing at the Garden for over a decade and have personally climbed or attempted roughly 75% of the rotues documented in this book. Several other diy guides to the area have been authored over the years as well. The following of these historical guidebooks have been referenced for this project:</p>
		<ul>
		  <li>The Garden Wall (Jayson Nissen, pdf, 2021)</li>
		  <li>Garden Area Bouldering (Cooper Doe, pdf, 2019)</li>
		  <li>The Garden (Paul Waters, unpublished/scanned pdf, circa 2011)</li>
		  <li>The Garden (Eric Brown, unpubished, circa 2001)</li>
		  <li>The Clear Cut (Apocalypse Now) (Eric Brown, unpubished, circa 2001)</li>
		  <li>Gordon Ridge/The Vines (Eric Brown, unpubished, circa 2001)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>I have primarily used these texts as references for names and locations, the descriptions and topos in The Garden Guidebook are all original work based on my own observations. I also personally know and have collaborated with some of the authors of these books as well as other developers of the area.</p>
