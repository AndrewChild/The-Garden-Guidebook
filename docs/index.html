        <h1>About the Project</h1>  
		<h2>Scope</h2>  
		<p>This guidebook is intended to be a comprehensive guide to the Garden climbing area located outside of Sweet Home, Oregon. Additional sections are included to document other nearby areas, but these areas are not covered in as great of detail. A PDF version is available for free <a href="https://github.com/AndrewChild/The-Garden-Guidebook/raw/main/guideBook.pdf">online</a> and a print version is in development. The guidebook is a living document that has been continuously developed since July of 2022.</p>
		<h2>Sharing</h2>  
		<p>This website, the Garden Guidebook, and the python code used to generate it are all being hosted on GitHub as open source software. That means that you are free to use, copy, share, and modify it as you please. That doesn't mean that I won't be upset if you just post the whole thing on Mountain Project verbatim.</p>
		<h2>Information Sources</h2>  
		<p>Much of the information in this book has been sourced from own my first hand knowledge of the area. I have been climbing at the Garden for over a decade and have climbed or attempted roughly 75% of the routes documented in this book. I have also actively collaborated with many other Garden regulars in the creation of this document.</p>
		<p>Several other DIY guides to the area have been authored over the years. At many times these texts along with online resources like Mountain Project have been used as references for names and locations, but the descriptions and topos in this guidebook are all original work.</p>

		<h2>Call for Photos</h2>  
		<p>A print version of the guidebook is currently in development. This version will be similar to the regular pdf except it will feature additional action and scenery photos. If you have photos that you want to be considered for the guidebook get in touch at <a href="mailto: an.child@gmail.com">an.child@gmail.com</a>. Anyone whose photo gets included in the guidebook will get a credit in the index and a free copy of the print guide. If you send a photo with a person in it please get their permission before sharing.</p>
